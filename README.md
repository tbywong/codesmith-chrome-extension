## "Now Playing" Chrome Extension
Too busy to keep up with what movies are out? I know I am. Download this extension for a quick scan of what movies are currently playing!  

### Background
A project made with [CarolAG](https://github.com/CarolAG) as part of [Codesmith's](https://codesmith.io) chrome extension hackathon in January 2016. Used themoviedb (TMDb) API for data.
